# TF2-PrivateMatchSettings

## WARNING THIS IS SPECIFICALLY FOR NORTHSTAR V1.12.5
Ignore the crappy readme I don't have time for this, if you want the source code maybe I'll put it here eventually but I'm lazy.
Only use with Northstar v1.12.*

WARNING : Ignore the error messages that may pop up when you launch your game, no seriously, like hit the "ignore" option for every one that pops up. I don't care enough to fix this. 



custom northstar.dll for Titanfall 2 that allows you to change private match settings in vanilla to anything. Also allows you to just change private match settings while using northstar with vanilla (something you couldn't do before in newer version of Northstar, it would only update client side, with this it updates server-side)

If you wanna change the settings past their normal values use this command : 
`setplaylistvaroverrides "playlistvar value"`
replace "playlistvar" with the var you want to change. You can find a list of modifiable vars here(not all of them will work) : https://r2northstar.gitbook.io/r2northstar-wiki/hosting-a-server-with-northstar/server-settings/playlistvar#playlist-overrides

replace "value" with the value you want the var to be. 

Also this lets you change map and mode even if you aren't host.
