# TF2-PrivateMatchSettings
custom northstar.dll for Titanfall 2 that allows you to change private match settings in vanilla to anything. Also allows you to just change private match settings while using northstar with vanilla (something you couldn't do before in newer version of Northstar, it would only update client side, with this it updates server-side)

If you wanna change the settings past their normal values use this command : 
``
